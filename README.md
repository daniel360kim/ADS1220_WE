# ADS1220_WE

This is an Arduino library for the 24-bit, 4 channel ADS1220 ADC. I have tried to make it convenient and easy to use. All features of the ADS1220 have been implemented. The examples should help to understand how to use the functions.

I haved added an example for using the excitations current IDAC1 and IDAC2 in the latest version. 

If you like the library, it would be great if you could give a star. If you find bugs, please inform me.

In some weeks I will publish a tutorial on my website:
